# Score_Administrator_C

A program that for a specific student provides his/her scores in different subjects.

The program also provides an add function in order to add a subject or a registration for a subject already added, a delete function to delete a registration, a search function to print all registrations for a specific subject and a function that prints the average score of the student.

Everything was implemented with system calls and not stdio library functions. The program also uses 2 files. One fora saving the names and weights of the subject and another one that saves the registrations.
